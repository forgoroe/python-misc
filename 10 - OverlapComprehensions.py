"""
This weekâ€™s exercise is going to be revisiting an old exercise (see Exercise 5), except require 
the solution in a different way.

Take two lists, say for example these two:

	a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
	b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are common between 
the lists (without duplicates). 
Make sure your program works on two lists of different sizes. 

Use list comprehensions.
Had to sets to avoid duplicates.

a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]

newList = [elementInA for elementInA in set(a) for elementInB in b if elementInA == elementInB]

print(newList)
